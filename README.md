# Constellation

A framework for creating libGDX-powered games in dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby. 

Constellation provides a framework that:

- Leverages libGDX as a solid, cross-platform game engine
- Provides integration to build libGDX games in Python, Ruby, and *insert your JVM-friendly language here*
- Provides tools to easily build your game against any platform (web, desktop, and mobile)
- Provides templates to create new projects

Currently, Constellation supports:

- Ruby (via JRuby)
- Python (via Jython)

Constellation aims to be a foundational platform for creating more game engines powered by libGDX and your dynamic language of choice. To extend it, plug in your own choice of Java-powered language library.
